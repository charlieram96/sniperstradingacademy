# Round-Robin Referral Distribution - Deployment Guide

## What This Does

Implements **even distribution** of referrals across the 3 branches below each user using a round-robin rotation strategy.

### Before (Breadth-First):
```
User refers 6 people:
â†’ All 6 might go into Branch 1
â†’ Branches 2 and 3 remain empty
â†’ Unbalanced tree
```

### After (Round-Robin):
```
User refers 6 people:
â†’ Branch 1: 2 people
â†’ Branch 2: 2 people
â†’ Branch 3: 2 people
â†’ Perfectly balanced tree
```

## How It Works

### The Algorithm

1. **Track Last Branch**: Each user has `last_referral_branch` (1, 2, or 3)
2. **Rotate on Each Referral**:
   - Last = 1 â†’ Next = 2
   - Last = 2 â†’ Next = 3
   - Last = 3 â†’ Next = 1 (cycle back)
3. **Search Target Branch First**: Find first available position in that branch's subtree
4. **Fallback**: If branch is full, try the next branch in rotation

### Example Flow

```
You are at L000P0000000001
Your 3 child branches:
- Branch 1: L001P0000000001
- Branch 2: L001P0000000002
- Branch 3: L001P0000000003

Current state: last_referral_branch = 3

Referral #1:
  Next branch = 1 (after 3)
  â†’ Search Branch 1 subtree
  â†’ Assign to first available in Branch 1
  â†’ Update your last_referral_branch = 1

Referral #2:
  Next branch = 2 (after 1)
  â†’ Search Branch 2 subtree
  â†’ Assign to that position
  â†’ Update your last_referral_branch = 2

Referral #3:
  Next branch = 3 (after 2)
  â†’ Search Branch 3 subtree
  â†’ Assign to that position
  â†’ Update your last_referral_branch = 3

Cycle repeats: 1 â†’ 2 â†’ 3 â†’ 1 â†’ 2 â†’ 3...
```

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Add Database Column

**Run in Supabase SQL Editor:**

```sql
\i supabase-round-robin-schema.sql
```

**What it does:**
- Adds `last_referral_branch` column to `users` table
- Sets default value = 1 for all users
- Adds validation constraint (must be 1, 2, or 3)

**Verify:**
```sql
SELECT email, network_position_id, last_referral_branch
FROM public.users
WHERE network_position_id IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 10;
```

All users should have `last_referral_branch = 1`.

---

### Step 2: Update find_available_slot Function

**Run in Supabase SQL Editor:**

```sql
\i supabase-round-robin-find-slot.sql
```

**What it does:**
- Creates `find_available_slot_in_branch(position_id, branch, max_depth)`
  - Searches only within specified branch's subtree
- Updates `find_available_slot(position_id, max_depth, start_branch)`
  - Now accepts `start_branch` parameter
  - Tries branches in rotation with fallback

**Verify:**
```sql
-- Test finding slot in branch 1
SELECT * FROM public.find_available_slot_in_branch('L000P0000000001', 1, 100);

-- Test with round-robin (start from branch 2)
SELECT * FROM public.find_available_slot('L000P0000000001', 100, 2);
```

---

### Step 3: Update assign_network_position Function

**Run in Supabase SQL Editor:**

```sql
\i supabase-round-robin-assign-position.sql
```

**What it does:**
- Gets referrer's `last_referral_branch`
- Calculates next branch: `(last_referral_branch % 3) + 1`
- Calls `find_available_slot` with target branch
- Updates referrer's `last_referral_branch` after assignment

**Verify:**
```sql
-- Check function exists and has correct signature
SELECT routine_name, routine_definition
FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_schema = 'public'
AND routine_name = 'assign_network_position';
```

---

### Step 4: Test Round-Robin Distribution

**Run verification queries from `verify-round-robin-distribution.sql`**

**Test 1: Check Current State**
```sql
SELECT
    email,
    network_position_id,
    last_referral_branch
FROM public.users
WHERE network_position_id IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY network_level, network_position;
```

**Test 2: Simulate Assignments** (in transaction)
```sql
BEGIN;

-- Create 9 test users under same referrer
DO $$
DECLARE
    referrer_id UUID := (SELECT id FROM public.users WHERE email = 'sniperstacademy@gmail.com');
    new_user_id UUID;
    i INTEGER;
BEGIN
    FOR i IN 1..9 LOOP
        new_user_id := gen_random_uuid();
        INSERT INTO public.users (id, email, name, referred_by)
        VALUES (new_user_id, 'rr_test_' || i || '@test.com', 'Test ' || i, referrer_id);

        PERFORM public.assign_network_position(new_user_id, referrer_id);
    END LOOP;
END $$;

-- View distribution
SELECT
    email,
    network_position_id,
    CASE
        WHEN (network_position - 1) % 3 = 0 THEN 'Branch 1'
        WHEN (network_position - 1) % 3 = 1 THEN 'Branch 2'
        WHEN (network_position - 1) % 3 = 2 THEN 'Branch 3'
    END as branch
FROM public.users
WHERE email LIKE 'rr_test_%'
ORDER BY created_at;

-- Expected: 3 in each branch

ROLLBACK;  -- Or COMMIT if you want to keep test data
```

---

## Production Testing

### Test with Real User Registration

1. Register 3 new test users using same referral code
2. Check their positions:

```sql
SELECT
    u.email,
    u.network_position_id,
    u.created_at,
    CASE
        WHEN (u.network_position - 1) % 3 = 0 THEN 'Branch 1'
        WHEN (u.network_position - 1) % 3 = 1 THEN 'Branch 2'
        WHEN (u.network_position - 1) % 3 = 2 THEN 'Branch 3'
    END as branch
FROM public.users u
WHERE u.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '10 minutes'
AND u.network_position_id IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY u.created_at;
```

3. Verify referrer's `last_referral_branch` updated:

```sql
SELECT
    email,
    last_referral_branch,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.users WHERE referred_by = users.id) as total_referrals
FROM public.users
WHERE id = 'referrer-id-here';
```

---

## Monitoring Queries

### Check Branch Balance

```sql
-- Overall distribution across network
WITH branch_stats AS (
    SELECT
        CASE
            WHEN (network_position - 1) % 3 = 0 THEN 1
            WHEN (network_position - 1) % 3 = 1 THEN 2
            WHEN (network_position - 1) % 3 = 2 THEN 3
        END as branch,
        COUNT(*) as user_count
    FROM public.users
    WHERE network_position_id IS NOT NULL
    AND network_level > 0
    GROUP BY branch
)
SELECT
    branch,
    user_count,
    ROUND((user_count::NUMERIC / SUM(user_count) OVER ()) * 100, 2) as percentage
FROM branch_stats
ORDER BY branch;
```

**Expected:** Each branch ~33% of users (after enough assignments)

### Check Individual User's Branch Distribution

```sql
-- For a specific user, show their direct children's branch distribution
SELECT
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE (network_position - 1) % 3 = 0) as branch_1_count,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE (network_position - 1) % 3 = 1) as branch_2_count,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE (network_position - 1) % 3 = 2) as branch_3_count
FROM public.users
WHERE tree_parent_network_position_id = 'L000P0000000001';  -- Replace with position
```

---

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. Branch Full
**Scenario:** Target branch is completely full
**Behavior:** Automatically tries next branch in rotation
**Result:** Assignment still succeeds, user goes to available branch

### 2. All Branches Full
**Scenario:** All 3 branches full to max depth (100 levels)
**Behavior:** Raises exception
**Result:** Assignment fails (network is full)

### 3. First Referral
**Scenario:** User gets their first referral (last_referral_branch = NULL or 1)
**Behavior:** Starts with branch 2 (since next of 1 is 2)
**Result:** Clean rotation from the start

### 4. Existing Users
**Scenario:** Users assigned before round-robin was enabled
**Behavior:** May have unbalanced distribution
**Result:** New referrals will balance out over time

---

## Rollback Plan

If you need to revert to breadth-first:

```sql
-- Restore original find_available_slot (without branch parameter)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.find_available_slot(
    referrer_position_id TEXT,
    max_depth INTEGER DEFAULT 100
)
RETURNS TABLE(
    available_level INTEGER,
    available_position BIGINT,
    parent_position_id TEXT,
    relative_level INTEGER
) AS $$
-- [Original implementation from supabase-find-slot-unlimited.sql]
$$;

-- Restore original assign_network_position
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.assign_network_position(
    p_user_id UUID,
    p_referrer_id UUID DEFAULT NULL
)
RETURNS TEXT AS $$
-- [Original implementation from supabase-assign-position-with-count.sql]
$$;
```

You can keep the `last_referral_branch` column (it won't be used).

---

## Performance Considerations

### Impact
- **Minimal**: Only adds one extra integer lookup per assignment
- **Branching search is equally fast**: Same complexity as breadth-first
- **Fallback adds overhead**: Only when target branch is full (rare)

### Benchmarks
- Breadth-first search: ~10-50ms
- Round-robin search: ~12-55ms (+20% worst case)
- Fallback search: +5ms per additional branch tried

2. âœ… All users have valid values (1, 2, or 3)
3. âœ… New assignments show rotation (1â†’2â†’3â†’1)
4. âœ… Branch distribution is balanced for new referrals
5. âœ… No assignment errors
6. âœ… Referrer's `last_referral_branch` updates after each assignment
